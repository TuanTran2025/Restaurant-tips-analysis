## 1. Introduction 
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.

## 2. Data Information

### Source of the data
The data is coming from the link: https://github.com/TuanTran2025/Restaurant-tips-analysis/blob/main/tips.csv

### Description of the dataset
The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.
It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

### Other source of data

## 3. The main goals
We will analyze the tip amount based on the following factors:
* the day it occurred
* if it was at lunch or dinner
* the sex of the person
* if they were a smoker or not

## 4. Results
Smokers tend to tip a bit more on average & may have more consistent tipping patterns at moderate-to-high levels.
Non-smokers being lower median tip suggests more small tippers &possibly a wider or left-skewed distribution.

Males tip more than females, both on average (mean) and typically (median). The highest tips are given by males, extending up to 10 bucks.
Females have a tighter tipping range, maxing out at 6.50 bucks ‚Äî suggesting less variance and fewer outliers.

On average, customers tend to tip more on weekends. This may reflect a more relaxed dining experience, higher total bills, or more social/group outings

Dinner service yields higher and more consistent tips.
Lunch service shows lower tipping behavior, possibly due to shorter or less formal meals.
